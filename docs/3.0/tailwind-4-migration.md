# TailwindCSS 4 Migration Guide

## Overview
With the upcoming release of Avo `3.19.0` in 1 April 2025 and no, this is not an April Fools' joke ðŸ˜„, the framework will fully transition to TailwindCSS 4. To facilitate a smooth migration process, Avo `3.18.x` (which uses TailwindCSS 3) will continue to be maintained alongside a parallel version, `3.18.x.tw4`, which incorporates TailwindCSS 4.

**We strongly encourage you to utilize the `3.18.x.tw4` version as a testing ground for the migration. By doing so, you can identify potential issues, provide feedback, and ensure a seamless transition before the official release of Avo `3.19.0` in 1 April 2025.**

This guide outlines the necessary steps to migrate to TailwindCSS 4, addressing two distinct scenarios:

1. **Projects without a TailwindCSS pipeline**
    - These setups do not have an existing TailwindCSS configuration
    - This is the case for most projects
    - There isn't much action to take
2. **Projects with an existing TailwindCSS pipeline**
    - These projects already utilize TailwindCSS.
    - Will need to adjust their configurations accordingly.

Each of these cases will be discussed in detail in their respective sections.

:::warning
Additionally, a dedicated section highlights [breaking changes](#tailwindcss-4-breaking-changes) that apply universally, regardless of your current TailwindCSS setup. Understanding these changes is crucial to ensure compatibility and avoid disruptions.
:::

Proceed to the following sections to determine the appropriate migration path for your project.

## Use the `3.18.x.tw4` version

:::info
`x` is the patch version, it can be `0`, `1`, `2`, etc., depending on the number of patch releases in the `3.18` minor version.

Each patch release will have both the TailwindCSS 3 and the TailwindCSS 4 versions of the gem.

Example:

```bash
# 3.18.0
# TailwindCSS 3 version
gem "avo", "3.18.0"
# TailwindCSS 4 version
gem "avo", "3.18.0.tw4"

# 3.18.1
# TailwindCSS 3 version
gem "avo", "3.18.1"
# TailwindCSS 4 version
gem "avo", "3.18.1.tw4"
```
:::

To test TailwindCSS 4, ensure you are using the following versions:

```bash
gem "avo", "3.18.x.tw4"
```

If you're utilizing `avo-rhino_field`, you must lock its version to `0.0.12.tw4`.

```ruby
gem "avo-rhino_field", "0.0.12.tw4"
```

Add the appropriate entry to your `Gemfile`, depending on your tier:
```ruby
# Avo Community
gem "avo", "3.18.x.tw4"

# Avo Pro
gem "avo", "3.18.x.tw4"
gem "avo-pro", "3.18.x", source: "https://packager.dev/avo-hq/"

# Avo Advanced
gem "avo", "3.18.x.tw4"
gem "avo-advanced", "3.18.x", source: "https://packager.dev/avo-hq/"
```

## Projects without a TailwindCSS pipeline

If you don't have a TailwindCSS pipeline, which should be the case for most cases, there isn't much to do besides following the steps in the [Use the `3.18.x.tw4` version](#use-the-3-18-x-tw4-version) section and address the [TailwindCSS 4 breaking changes](#tailwindcss-4-breaking-changes) below.

After, you can use the `3.18.x.tw4` version of the gem and it will work just fine and ready for the Avo `3.19.0` release.


## You do have a TailwindCSS pipeline

[WIP]

## TailwindCSS 4 breaking changes

TailwindCSS 4 introduces several breaking changes that might affect your application. While we highlight some common changes below, we strongly recommend reviewing the [official TailwindCSS 4 upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide) for a comprehensive list of changes.

You need to apply this changes on all the Avo related custom components that you have in your application. That includes:

- Custom fields
- Resource tools
- Custom tools
- Custom cards
- Ejected components

### Renamed Utilities

TailwindCSS 4 has renamed several utilities to make them more consistent and predictable.

We'll highlight the most common use-case encountered in the Avo codebase, please refer to the whole [Renamed Utilities list](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#renamed-utilities) for more details.

| TailwindCSS 3 Utility | TailwindCSS 4 Utility |
|------------|------------|
| rounded-sm | rounded-xs |
| rounded | rounded-sm |
| ... | ... |

For example, update your code from:

```html
<div class="rounded-sm"> <!-- TailwindCSS 3 -->  // [!code --]
<div class="rounded-xs"> <!-- TailwindCSS 4 --> // [!code ++]
  Content
</div>

<div class="rounded"> <!-- TailwindCSS 3 -->  // [!code --]
<div class="rounded-sm"> <!-- TailwindCSS 4 --> // [!code ++]
  Content
</div>
```

:::tip
If you're applying global search and bulk replace do the `rounded-sm` to `rounded-xs` transition first, then do the `rounded` to `rounded-sm` transition.
:::

### Default Border Color

In TailwindCSS 4, the default border color has changed from `gray-200` to `currentColor`. This affects both `border-*` and `divide-*` utilities. You'll need to explicitly specify border colors where you previously relied on the default.

For example, update your code from:

```html
<div class="border p-4"> <!-- TailwindCSS 3 -->  // [!code --]
<div class="border border-gray-200 p-4"> <!-- TailwindCSS 4 --> // [!code ++]
  Content with default gray border
</div>
```

:::tip
Do a global search for `border` and `divide` and verify where they have any implicit color borders. Add the `border-gray-200` and `divide-gray-200` classes to the elements that don't have an explicit color.
