# Kanban boards

:::warning
The feature and docs are both work in progress. Please read the `info` sections below.
:::


Having a kanban board is a great way to organize your work and keep track of your records.

## Overview

The Kanban Board feature is a way to create a kanban board for your resources. They support multiple resources. Think about GitHub's Projects. You can have Issues, PRs, and simple tasks on them.

The boards and columns and items are database backed and you can create them on the fly.

## Requirements

Some of these requirements might change over time.

- We tested this on an app with Avo Advanced license
- [`acts_as_list`](https://github.com/brendon/acts_as_list) gem (comes automatically as a requirement)
- [`hotwire_combobox`](https://github.com/josefarias/hotwire_combobox) gem (comes automatically as a requirement)

## DB schema

`Avo::Kanban::Board` -> has_many `Avo::Kanban::Column` -> has_many `Avo::Kanban::Item`

The `Avo::Kanban::Column` has a polymorphic `belongs_to` association with any other model you might have in your app.

## Create a kanban board

We can create a kanban board by going to the Boards resource and clicking on the `Create board` button.

Once you create the board, add it to the menu using the `link_to` option (for now. we'll add `board` soon).

## Create columns

For now you can create the columns from the resource view.

By default, each column will have a `name` and `value` assigned to it. It will also have a `position` that you can use to sort the columns.

The `value` is what is being used to update the record when it's dropped into a new column.

## Configure the board

Each board has a configuration attached to it.
We can configure what kind of resources can be added to the board.

Similar we can change the column names and the value from the settings screen.

Only the admins (`user.is_admin?`) can see the setting button and screen.

## Adding items to the board

This is best done on the board. Under each column you'll find the new field. This will search throught the resources that you've selected in the configuration.
It will use the `self.search[:query]` block to search for the records. It will send two `for_kanban_board` and `board_id` arguments to the block so you can customize the query.

When an item is added to the a column, it will have an `Avo::Kanban::Item` record created for it. This `Item` record is responsible for keeping track of the board, column, position properties and more.

When an item is added to the a column it will update the property on the record to the column's `value`. More on what this means in the next section.

## How does it work?

<!-- Let's take a look -->
Each board updates one `property` on the `record`, and each column represents a `value`.
The record is the actual record from the database (User, Project, To Do, etc.).

Let's say we are replicating the GitHub Projects boards.


### `Board` and `Column`s

We should have a `Board` record with the following columns:

- `No status` with an empty string as value
- `Backlog` with the value `backlog`
- `In progress` with the value `in_progress`
- `Done` with the value `done`

The board has the `property` option set to `status` so we ensure that the `status` property of the record is updated when we move the item to a new column.

### `Resource`s and `Item`s

We should have `Issue`, `PullRequest`, and `ToDo` models and resources. The resources should have the `self.search[:query]` block configured.

The models should have the `to_combobox_display` method configured so we know what to show in the search result. We might remove this requirement in the future.

Next in our board we should select these resources as allowed from the board settings.

At the bottom of the `No status` column we can search for an `Issue`. When we select that issue, an `Avo::Kanban::Item` record will be created for it with references to the board, column, and record (that issue).
This automatically triggers the issue to change the status to an empty string because we added it to the `No status` column which has the `value` set to an empty string.

If we were to add it to the `Backlog` column, it would change the status to `backlog`.

Now, if we move the item to the `In progress` column, it will change the status to `in_progress`.
