# Actions Overview

<DemoVideo demo-video="https://youtu.be/BK47E7TMXn0?t=778" class="mt-4" />

Actions in Avo are powerful tools that transform the way you interact with your data. They enable you to perform operations on one or multiple records simultaneously, extending your interface with custom functionality that goes beyond basic CRUD operations.

## What Are Actions?

Think of Actions as custom operations you can trigger from your admin interface. They're like specialized commands that can:
- Process single records or work in batch mode
- Collect additional information through customizable forms
- Trigger background jobs
- Generate reports or export data
- Modify record states
- Send notifications
- And much more...

## Key Benefits

### 1. Streamlined Workflows
Instead of building custom interfaces for common operations, Actions provide a standardized way to perform complex tasks right from your admin panel.

### 2. Flexibility
Actions can be as simple or as complex as you need:
- Simple toggles for changing record states
- Multi-step processes with user input on each step
- Background job triggers for heavy operations
- API integrations with external services

### 3. Batch Operations
Save time by performing operations on multiple records at once. Whether you're updating statuses, sending notifications, or processing data, batch actions have you covered.

### 4. User Input Forms
When additional information is needed, Actions can present custom forms to collect data before execution. These forms are fully customizable and support various field types.

## Common Use Cases

- **User Management**: Activate/deactivate accounts, reset passwords, or send welcome emails
- **Content Moderation**: Approve/reject content, flag items for review
- **Data Processing**: Generate reports, export data, or trigger data transformations
- **Communication**: Send notifications, emails, or SMS messages
- **State Management**: Change status, toggle features, or update permissions
- **Batch Updates**: Modify multiple records with consistent changes
- **Integration Triggers**: Connect with external APIs or services

Common use cases include managing user states, sending notifications, and automating data processing. Their flexibility makes them essential for building robust interfaces, streamlining workflows, and managing data efficiently.
