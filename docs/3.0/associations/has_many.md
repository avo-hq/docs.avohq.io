# Has Many

By default, the `HasMany` field is visible only on the `Show` view. You will see a new panel with the model's associated records below the regular fields panel.

```ruby
field :projects, as: :has_many
```

<Option name="`linkable`">
You can add use this option to make the association title clickable. That link will open a new page with the same view.

This feature doesn't go deeper than this. It just helps you see the association table easier in a separate page.
