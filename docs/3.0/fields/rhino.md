# Rhino

The wonderful [Rhino Editor](https://rhino-editor.vercel.app/) built by [Konnor Rogers](https://www.konnorrogers.com/) is available and fully integrated with Avo.

```ruby
field :body, as: :rhino
```

Rhino is based on [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/) which is a powerful and flexible editor.

The Rhino field supports [ActiveStorage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) file attachments and seamlessly integrates with the [Media Library](./media-library).
