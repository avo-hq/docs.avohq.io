# EasyMDE

:::info
Before Avo 3.17 this field was called `markdown`. It was renamed to `easy_mde` so we can add our own implementation with `markdown`.

The `easy_mde` field renders a [EasyMDE Markdown Editor](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor) and is associated with a text or textarea column in the database.
`easy_mde` field converts text within the editor into raw Markdown text and stores it back in the database.

```ruby
field :description, as: :easy_mde
```

:::info
The `easy_mde` field is hidden from the **Index** view.

### Default behavior
