# Tip Tap

The `TipTap` field is deprecated in favor of the [Rhino](./rhino) field.

The Rhino field is a fork of the TipTap editor with some additional features and improvements.

The Rhino field is fully integrated with Avo and provides a seamless experience for managing rich text content using the [ActiveStorage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) integration and the [Media Library](./media-library).
