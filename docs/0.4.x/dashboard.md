# Dashboard

[[toc]]

At the moment, Avo provides a simple Dashboard with **Getting started** instructions and a tiny **Resource Overview** component. We have it on our road map to bring you easy-to-use configuration-based widgets similar to resources.

You may *at this moment* configure if you want to hide the documentation link by adding `config.hide_documentation_link = true` to your `config/initializers/avo.rb` file.

Similar you may hide the whole component with this line `config.hide_resource_overview_component = true`
