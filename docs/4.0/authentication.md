# Authentication

With Avo, you have the flexibility to build apps either with or without authentication. While Avo has minimal assumptions about its users, a few guidelines still apply:

1. Users can be either authenticated or not. Avo apps can be developed without requiring user authentication.
2. If you choose to implement authentication, you need to [define the current_user](#customize-the-current-user-method).
3. You can assign [lightweight roles](#user-roles) to your users.
4. Any authentication strategy or gem of your choice can be utilized.

:::info Rails 8 authentication scaffold
In essence, the [authentication scaffold](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52328) that Rails 8 comes with is custom authentication so we need to do a few things to ensure it's working.

Please follow [this guide](./guides/rails-authentication-scaffold) to enable it.
:::

## Customize the `current_user` method

Avo will not assume your authentication provider (the `current_user` method returns `nil`). That means that you have to tell Avo who the `current_user` is.

<Option name="Rails authentication scaffold">

Please follow [this guide](./guides/rails-authentication-scaffold) to Rails' authentication scaffold.

</Option>

<Option name="Devise">

For [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise), you should set it to `current_user`.

```ruby
# config/initializers/avo.rb
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.current_user_method = :current_user
end
```
</Option>

<Option name="Other methods">

Using another authentication provider, you may customize the `current_user` method to something else.

```ruby
# config/initializers/avo.rb
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.current_user_method = :current_admin
end
```

If you get the current user from another object like `Current.user`, you may pass a block to the `current_user_method` key.

```ruby
# config/initializers/avo.rb
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.current_user_method do
    Current.user
  end
end
```

</Option>

## Customize the sign-out link

If your app responds to `destroy_user_session_path`, a sign-out menu item will be added on the bottom sidebar (when you click the three dots). If your app does not respond to this method, the link will be hidden unless you provide a custom sign-out path. There are two ways to customize the sign-out path.

### Customize the current user resource name

You can customize just the "user" part of the path name by setting `current_user_resource_name`. For example if you follow the `User` -> `current_user` convention, you might have a `destroy_current_user_session_path` that logs the user out.

```ruby
# config/initializers/avo.rb
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.current_user_resource_name = :current_user
end
```

Or if your app provides a `destroy_current_admin_session_path` then you would need to set `current_user_resource_name` to `current_admin`.

```ruby
# config/initializers/avo.rb
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.current_user_resource_name = :current_admin
end
```

### Customize the entire sign-out path

Alternatively, you can customize the sign-out path name completely by setting `sign_out_path_name`. For example, if your app provides `logout_path` then you would pass this name to `sign_out_path_name`.

```ruby
# config/initializers/avo.rb
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.sign_out_path_name = :logout_path
end
```

If both `current_user_resource_name` and `sign_out_path_name` are set, `sign_out_path_name` takes precedence.

## Filter out requests

You probably do not want to allow Avo access to everybody. If you're using [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) in your app, use this block to filter out requests in your `routes.rb` file.

```ruby
authenticate :user do
  mount_avo at: '/avo'
end
```

You may also add custom user validation such as `user.admin?` to only permit a subset of users to your Avo instance.

```ruby
authenticate :user, -> user { user.admin? } do
  mount_avo at: '/avo'
end
```

Check out more examples of authentication on [sidekiq's authentication section](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Monitoring#authentication).

## `authenticate_with` method

Alternatively, you can use the `authenticate_with` config attribute. It takes a block and evaluates it in Avo's `ApplicationController` as a `before_action`.

```ruby
# config/initializers/avo.rb
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.authenticate_with do
    authenticate_admin_user
  end
end
```

Note that Avo's `ApplicationController` does not inherit from your app's `ApplicationController`, so any protected methods you defined would not work. Instead, you would need to explicitly write the authentication logic in the block. For example, if you store your `user_id` in the session hash, then you can do:

```ruby
# config/initializers/avo.rb
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.authenticate_with do
    redirect_to '/' unless session[:user_id] == 1 # hard code user ids here
  end
end
```

## User roles

There might be cases where you want to signal to Avo that the current user has a role.

Avo roles are very lightweight and that's for a reason. Building with roles in mind requires a bit more integration with the parent app. This is something that you can definitely take upon yourself to build if you need it.

There are two extra roles that you can give to a user, besides the regular user. These roles can be assigned with a check on the `current_user` object.

<Option name="1. Admin user">

The check that Avo will do to figure that out is to run the `is_admin?` method on the [`current_user`](#customize-the-current-user-method) object.

#### Check if a user is an admin

You can do that check yourself using the `Avo::Current.user_is_admin?`.

#### When does Avo check if the use is an admin (`is_admin?`)

Avo doesn't use this setting momentarily but might in the future.

</Option>

<Option name="2. Developer user">

There might be cases where you want to signal that a user is a developer. The developer will be able to see extra things like long backtrace messages in errors.

The check that Avo will do to figure that out is to run the `is_developer?` method on the [`current_user`](#customize-the-current-user-method) object.

### Check if a user is an developer

You can do that check yourself using the `Avo::Current.user_is_developer?`.

### When does Avo check if the use is an developer (`is_developer?`)

Avo uses this role to display long backtraces on non-validation errors.
Ex: on record save, you might call an API which by some reason errors out. Instead of just getting a generic "Something went wrong" error, the developer user will see the error message and backtrace

</Option>

### Customize the methods that check for roles

You may customize the methods that Avo uses to assign roles in the initializer.

```ruby
# config/avo.rb
Avo.configure do |config|
  config.is_admin_method = :is_admin?
  config.is_developer_method = :is_developer?
end
```

## Authorization

When you share access to Avo with your clients or large teams, you may want to restrict access to a resource or a subset of resources. You should set up your authorization rules (policies) to do that. Check out the [authorization page](authorization) for details on how to set that up.
