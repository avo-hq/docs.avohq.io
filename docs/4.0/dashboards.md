# Dashboards

:::warning
You must manually require the `chartkick` gem in your `Gemfile`.

```ruby
# Create beautiful JavaScript charts with one line of Ruby
gem "chartkick"
```
:::

There comes the point in your app's life when you need to display the data in an aggregated form like a metric or chart. That's what Avo's Dashboards are all about.

## Generate a dashboard

Run `bin/rails g avo:dashboard my_dashboard` to get a shiny new dashboard.

```ruby
class Avo::Dashboards::MyDashboard < Avo::Dashboards::BaseDashboard
  self.id = 'my_dashboard'
  self.name = 'Dashy'
  self.description = 'The first dashbaord'
  self.grid_cols = 3

  def cards
    card Avo::Cards::ExampleMetric
    card Avo::Cards::ExampleAreaChart
    card Avo::Cards::ExampleScatterChart
    card Avo::Cards::PercentDone
    card Avo::Cards::AmountRaised
    card Avo::Cards::ExampleLineChart
    card Avo::Cards::ExampleColumnChart
    card Avo::Cards::ExamplePieChart
    card Avo::Cards::ExampleBarChart
    divider label: "Custom partials"
    card Avo::Cards::ExampleCustomPartial
    card Avo::Cards::MapCard
  end
end
```

## Settings

Each dashboard is a file. It holds information about itself like the `id`, `name`, `description`, and how many columns its grid has.

The `id` field has to be unique. The `name` is what the user sees in big letters on top of the page, and the `description` is some text you pass to give the user more details regarding the dashboard.

Using the ' grid_cols ' parameter, you may organize the cards in a grid with `3`, `4`, `5`, or `6` columns using the `grid_cols` parameter. The default is `3`.

## Cards
[This section has moved.](cards.html)

### Override card arguments from the dashboard

We found ourselves in the position to add a few cards that were the same card but with a slight difference. Ex: Have one `Users count` card and another `Active users count` card. They both count users, but the latter has an `active: true` condition applied.

Before, we'd have to duplicate that card and modify the `query` method slightly but end up with duplicated boilerplate code.
For those scenarios, we created the `arguments` attribute. It allows you to send arbitrary arguments to the card from the parent.

```ruby{7-9}
class Avo::Dashboards::Dashy < Avo::Dashboards::BaseDashboard
  self.id = "dashy"
  self.name = "Dashy"

  def cards
    card Avo::Cards::UsersCount
    card Avo::Cards::UsersCount, arguments: {
      active_users: true
    }
  end
end
```

Now we can pick up that option in the card and update the query accordingly.

```ruby{9-11}
class Avo::Cards::UsersCount < Avo::Cards::MetricCard
  self.id = "users_metric"
  self.label = "Users count"

  # You have access to context, params, range, current parent, and current card
  def query
    scope = User

    if arguments[:active_users].present?
      scope = scope.active
    end

    result scope.count
  end
end
```

That gives you an extra layer of control without code duplication and the best developer experience.

#### Control the base settings from the parent

Evidently, you don't want to show the same `label`, `description`, and other details for that second card from the first card.
Therefore, you can control the `label`, `description`, `cols`, `rows`, `visible`, and `refresh_every` arguments from the parent declaration.

```ruby{8-16}
class Avo::Dashboards::Dashy < Avo::Dashboards::BaseDashboard
  self.id = "dashy"
  self.name = "Dashy"

  def cards
    card Avo::Cards::UsersCount
    card Avo::Cards::UsersCount,
      label: "Active users",
      description: "Active users count",
      cols: 2,
      rows: 2,
      visible: -> { true }
      refresh_every: 2.minutes,
      arguments: {
        active_users: true
      }
  end
end
```

## Dashboards visibility

You might want to hide specific dashboards from certain users. You can do that using the `visible` option. The option can be a boolean `true`/`false` or a block where you have access to the `params`, `current_user`, `context`, and `dashboard`.

If you don't pass anything to `visible`, the dashboard will be available for anyone.

```ruby{5-11}
class Avo::Dashboards::ComplexDash < Avo::Dashboards::BaseDashboard
  self.id = "complex_dash"
  self.name = "Complex dash"
  self.description = "Complex dash description"
  self.visible = -> do
    current_user.is_admin?
    # or
    params[:something] == 'something else'
    # or
    context[:your_param] == params[:something_else]
  end

  def cards
    card Avo::Cards::UsersCount
  end
end
```

## Dashboards authorization

<VersionReq version="2.22" />

You can set authorization rules for dashboards using the `authorize` block.

```ruby{3-6}
class Avo::Dashboards::Dashy < Avo::Dashboards::BaseDashboard
  self.id = 'dashy'
  self.authorize = -> do
    # You have access to current_user, params, request, context, adn view_context.
    current_user.is_admin?
  end
end
```

<Option name="`self.name`">

`self.name` is what is going to be displayed to the user as the dashboard name.

```ruby
self.name = "Dashy"
```

<VersionReq version="3.14.2" /> `self.name` can be configured using a Proc.

```ruby
self.name = -> { I18n.t("avo.dashboards.dashy.name") }
```

Within this block, you gain access to all attributes of [`Avo::ExecutionContext`](execution-context) along with the `dashboard`.

</Option>
