# FAQ

## Show/hide buttons throughout the admin

You might want to hide some buttons and not show them to your users. That's pretty handy using the [`Authorization`](authorization) feature. Then, you control the display of those buttons using the policy methods.

- Show button -> `show?` method
- Edit button -> `edit?` method
- Delete button -> `destroy?` method
- Upload attachments button -> `upload_{FIELD_ID}?` method
- Download attachments button -> `download_{FIELD_ID}?` method
- Delete attachments button -> `delete_{FIELD_ID}?` method
- Attach button -> `attach_#{RESOURCE_PLURL_NAME}?` (eg: `attach_posts?`) method
- Detach button -> `detach_#{RESOURCE_PLURL_NAME}?` (eg: `detach_posts?`) method

## Why don't regular URL helpers work as expected?

When writing rails code somewhere in the Avo domain you might want to use your regular URL helpers like the below:

```ruby{2}
field :partner_home, as: :text, as_html: true do
  link_to 'Partner', partner_home_url(record)
end
```

That will not work because Avo will execute that code inside itself, a Rails engine. So per the [Rails documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html#routes) you have to prepend the helper with `main_app` for it to work. Rails needs to know which engine it should find a route for. So the query becomes this ðŸ‘‡

```ruby{2}
field :partner_home, as: :text, as_html: true do
  link_to 'Partner', main_app.partner_home_url(record)
end
```

## I want to give access to different kinds of users to various resources.

You can do that using Pundit scopes and the Authorization feature. You create a policy for that resource and set the condition on the `index?` method. More on that on the [authorization](authorization) page and Pundit's [docs](https://github.com/varvet/pundit).

Authorization is a Pro feature for Avo. Please [reach out](https://avohq.io/subscriptions/new?plan=2&trial=1) if you need a trial key to test it out.

## How can I set a homepage for the admin section

You can do that using the [home_path](customization.html#home-path) configuration. You just set `config.home_path = "/avo/resources/posts"` (or whatever path you'd like) in the Avo initializer, and you're all set up. The user will be redirected to that path when navigating to `/avo`.


```ruby{8}
# config/initializers/avo.rb

Avo.configure do |config|
  config.root_path = '/avo'
  config.license_key = ENV['AVO_LICENSE_KEY']
  config.id_links_to_resource = true
  config.home_path = '/avo/resources/posts'
  config.set_context do
    {
      foo: 'bar',
      user: current_user,
      params: request.params,
    }
  end
end
```

## I want to have two different resources mapped to the same model with different types

That depends on your setup:

1. If you have [Rails STI](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#single-table-inheritance-sti), then it will work. Avo knows how to handle STI models. So you'll have two models and an Avo resource for each one. That will render two resources in your admin panel's sidebar.
2. You don't have Rails STI but something custom. Then the response is it depends. Because something custom is... custom, we offer a few mechanisms to get over that.

If you have one model, `User`, you'll have one Avo resource, `Avo::Resources::User`.
Then you can customize different things based on your requirements. Like if for instance, you want to show only some types of users on the `Index` view, you can use [custom query scopes](https://docs.avohq.io/1.0/customization.html#custom-query-scopes) to hide specific types (if that's what you want to do).
Same if you want to [show/hide fields](https://docs.avohq.io/1.0/field-options.html#field-visibility) based on the resource type or type of user.

All in all **we're confident you'll have the necessary instruments** you need to build your admin.

### STI example

For **STI** you can check out the models and resources in the [demo app](https://main.avodemo.com/).

 - [person.rb](https://github.com/avo-hq/avodemo/blob/main/app/models/person.rb)
 - [spouse.rb](https://github.com/avo-hq/avodemo/blob/main/app/models/spouse.rb)
 - [person_resource.rb](https://github.com/avo-hq/avodemo/blob/main/app/avo/resources/person_resource.rb)
 - [spouse_resource.rb](https://github.com/avo-hq/avodemo/blob/main/app/avo/resources/spouse_resource.rb)

One thing you should do is for the derived model (`Spouse` in this case) add the `model_class` to [the Avo resource](https://github.com/avo-hq/avodemo/blob/main/app/avo/resources/spouse_resource.rb#L5).

## Try a pre-release version

We push pre-release versions of the gem from time to time for you to try out before pushing it to the `main` branch. To test them out, specify the exact version in your `Gemfile`.

Let's say you want to try out `1.19.1.pre.1`. You need to specify it like below ðŸ‘‡

```ruby
# Gemfile

# ... other gems

gem 'avo', '1.19.1.pre.1'
```

## The authorization features are not working

If you're having trouble with the authorization feature, make sure you have the following enabled:

- you are on a [Pro](licensing) license
- you have set the [`current_user_method`](authentication.html#customize-the-current-user-method)
- you have reset the rails server after the above settings
- you have the pundit policy on the appropriate model

## Add custom methods/get custom data

You might want to be able to send custom data to some of the blocks you use (`default` block, computed fields, field formatters, etc.). You can use the `context` block. The block is evaluated in the `ApplicationController` so it can access the `params` and other common controller methods. More on that [here](customization#context).

## Get access to the `ActionView` helper methods

For convenience sake, we capture the `view_context` for you and set it to the `Avo::App.view_context` global object. You can use all the `ActionView` methods you'd regularly use in your helpers throughout your Avo configuration.

On the `Resource` and `Field` classes, it's already delegated for you, so you can just use `view_context`.

```ruby{7,10}
class Avo::Resources::Comment < Avo::BaseResource
  def fields
    field :id, as: :id
    field :body,
      as: :textarea,
      format_using: -> do
        view_context.content_tag(:div, style: 'white-space: pre-line') { value }
      end
    field :computed_field, as: :text do
      view_context.link_to("Login", main_app.new_user_session_path)
    end
  end
end
```

## Render new lines for textarea fields

**From version 2.8**

When adding content using the `textarea` field, you might see that the newlines are not displayed on the `Show` view.

```ruby{3}
class Avo::Resources::Comment < Avo::BaseResource
  def fields
    field :body, as: :textarea
  end
end
```

<Image src="/assets/img/faq/newline/edit.png" width="1560" height="1160" alt="Render new lines" />
<Image src="/assets/img/faq/newline/default.png" width="1560" height="1160" alt="Render new lines" />

You can change how you display the information by using the `format_using` option.

### Use `simple_format`

```ruby{6}
class Avo::Resources::Comment < Avo::BaseResource
  def fields
    field :body,
      as: :textarea,
      format_using: -> do
        simple_format value
      end
  end
end
```

<Image src="/assets/img/faq/newline/simple_format.png" width="1560" height="1160" alt="Render new lines" />

### Use the `white-space: pre-line` style rule

```ruby{6}
class Avo::Resources::Comment < Avo::BaseResource
  def fields
    field :body,
      as: :textarea,
      format_using: -> do
        content_tag(:div, style: 'white-space: pre-line') { value }
      end
    end
end
```

<Image src="/assets/img/faq/newline/whitespace.png" width="1560" height="1160" alt="Render new lines" />

### Use the `whitespace-pre-line` class

```ruby{6}
class Avo::Resources::Comment < Avo::BaseResource
  def fields
    field :body,
      as: :textarea,
      format_using: -> do
        content_tag(:div, class: 'whitespace-pre-line') { value }
      end
  end
end
```

<Image src="/assets/img/faq/newline/whitespace.png" width="1560" height="1160" alt="Render new lines" />
