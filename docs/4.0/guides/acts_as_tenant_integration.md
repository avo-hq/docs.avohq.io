# Acts As Tenant Integration

Recipe [contributed](https://github.com/avo-hq/docs.avohq.io/pull/218) by [SahSantoshh](https://github.com/sahsantoshh).

:::warning
The guide expressed here shows how you we can add subdomain-level multitenancy (sah.example.org, adrian.example.org, etc).

This makes for more than one URL per application which in turn requires a special license.
To get more information please [reach out](mailto:avo@avohq.io?subject=Multi-URL%20tenancy%20with%20Avo&body=Hi%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20develop%20a%20multi-URL%20application%20using%20Avo.%0D%0A%0D%0A...) to us.
:::

There are different ways to achieve multi-tenancy in an application.
We already have a doc which describes about [Multitenancy](../multitenancy.md) with Avo.
Here we will deep dive in integrating [Acts As Tenant](https://github.com/ErwinM/acts_as_tenant) which supports row-level multitenancy with Avo.
In this implementation we will be setting tenant to subdomain.

:::info
Check out the [acts_as_tenant](https://github.com/ErwinM/acts_as_tenant) documentation for reference.

## Installation

To use it, add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'acts_as_tenant'
```

## Tenant

Let's create model for tenant. We are using `Account` as our tenant.

**Account Migration and Model class**

:::code-group
```ruby [db/migrate/random_number_create_accounts.rb]{3}
# Migration
class CreateAccounts < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :accounts do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :subdomain

      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index :accounts, :subdomain, unique: true
    add_index :accounts, :created_at
  end
end
```
```ruby [app/models/account.rb]{3}
# Account model handles Tenant management
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  MAX_SUBDOMAIN_LENGTH = 20

  validates :name, :subdomain, presence: true
  validates_uniqueness_of :name, :subdomain, case_sensitive: false
  validates_length_of :subdomain, :name, maximum: MAX_SUBDOMAIN_LENGTH

end
```
:::

## Scope models
___

Now let's add users to `Account`. Here I am assuming to have an existing user model which is used for `Authentication`.
Similarly we can scope other models.

:::code-group
```ruby [db/migrate/random_number_add_account_to_users.rb]{3}
class AddAccountToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    add_column :users, :account_id, :integer # if we have existing user set null to true then update the data using seed
    add_index  :users, :account_id
  end
end
```
```ruby [app/models/account.rb]{3}
# Authentication
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_tenant(:account)
end
```
:::

## Setting the current tenant

There are three ways to set the current tenant but we be using the subdomain to lookup the current tenant.
Since Avo has it's own `Application Controller` so there is no point in setting the tenant in Rails default `Application Controller` but we will set it there as well just to be safe site and also we might have some other pages other than Admin Dashboard supported by Avo.

:::code-group
```ruby [app/controllers/concerns/multitenancy.rb]{3}
# Multitenancy, to set the current account/tenant.
module Multitenancy
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    prepend_before_action :set_current_account
  end

  def set_current_account
    hosts = request.host.split('.')

    # just to make sure we are using subdomain path
    subdomain = (hosts[0] if hosts.length > 2)

    # We only allow users to login from their account specific subdomain not outside of it.
    sign_out(current_user) if subdomain.blank?

    current_account = Account.find_by(subdomain:)
    sign_out(current_user) if current_account.blank?

    # set tenant for Avo and ActAsTenant
    ActsAsTenant.current_tenant = current_account
    Avo::Current.tenant = current_account
    Avo::Current.tenant_id = current_account.id
  end
end
```

```ruby [config/initializers/avo.rb]{3}
Avo.configure do |config|
  # configuration values
end

Rails.configuration.to_prepare do
  Avo::ApplicationController.include Multitenancy
end
```
:::

Now, whenever we navigate to https://sahsantoshh.example.com/ the tenant & the tenant_id will be set to **sahsantoshh**.

## Move existing data to model

We might have to many users and other records which needs to be associated with `Account`.
For example, we will only move users record to the account

:::code-group
```ruby [db/seeds.rb]{3}
# Create default/first account where we want to associate exiting data
account = Account.find_or_create_by!(name: 'Nepal', subdomain: 'sahsantoshh')

User.unscoped.in_batches do |relation|
  relation.update_all(account_id: account.id)
  sleep(0.01) # throttle
end
```
:::

Now run the seed command to update existing records
